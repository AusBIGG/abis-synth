= BDR Gateway Test Client

This is a small Python web client made to test the http://bdrgateway.surroundaustralia.com[BDR Gateway] API which is used to absorb data into the _Biodiversity Data Repository_ being built for the https://www.awe.gov.au[Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment].

This tool is mostly for internal testing but may be copied by others for their use.

== Data

=== Example Messages

See folder `tests_data/messages/`. These are the same message examples listed in the BDR Gateway.

=== Validators

See folder `tests_data/validators/`.

Currently only:

* BDR Messages Validator
* VocPub BDR Validator

TERN validator to be added soon

== Use

The script `validate_egs.py` attempts to validate each example message file using all the validators combined.
